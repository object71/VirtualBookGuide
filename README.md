# VirtualBookGuide

University project for a mobile application. The project is an idea of mine as I was interested in travelling Bulgaria and going to the 100 monuments, museums and places. The app gives all the relevant information for the different places and working times and it is a great idea and inspiration.

## Possiblities

It could've turned into a great app and with the possibility instead of collecting marks to scan barcodes at the key points.
